        It has 11 members, a Co-ordinator and the Principal of the College. It’s objective
        is to create awareness among and to give exposure to staff and students about the
        use of computers in various activities like administration, finance, examination
        and research. In addition to it the information and communication network would
        help the College to have an access to multimedia material in teaching and learning
        at places of eminence in the country and abroad.
