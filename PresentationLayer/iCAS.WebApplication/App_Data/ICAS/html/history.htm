                In the mid-seventies of the last century the state woke up to establish quite a
                good number of colleges to afford expanded educational opportunities to the rising
                youth populace of the state on par with the national average. The local people realized
                the deficit of an institution for higher study for which the vulnerable section
                of the local community is deprived of higher education. Specifically the girl child
                and SC/ST/OBC students unable to afford the cost of higher education and join the
                swelling army of the dropouts. But they can pursue a higher and qualitative goal
                at a lower social and economic cost at their door steps if the deficit is made up
                with a college.</p>
            -->
            <p>
                The college started with an intake capacity of 128 seats in Intermediate Arts, Science
                and 64 seats in Intermediate Commerce affiliated to B.U, subsequently converted
                to +2. +3 courses in Arts and Science has been introduced since 1991-92 and 2009-10
                respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dream got a shape at the hands of the local elites like Late Dandapani Tripathy,
                Advocate Sri L. N. Dash, Sri Kasinath Tripathy, Sri Prafulla Panigrahy, Sri Kishore
                Chandra Tripathy, Sri Gobinda Barika and others, with the inspiration of the freedom
                fighter, journalist, luminary Padma Bhusan Radhanath Rath, Ex-President of Loka
                Sevaka Mandal and the renowned Editor of the Oriya Daily “The Samaja” who acted
                as the first President of Governing Body. With the active cooperation of the generous
                people of the locality this college initially started in the school building donated
                by the villagers of Tentulia since July 1981, where now stands a market complex
                fetching a perennial flow of income for the college.

                The College started with 10 Lecturers in all the three streams equipped with eight
                Non-teaching staff members. The academic affairs of the college was vested in the
                hands of Principals in-charge up to 4th October 1990 and there after the Department
                of Higher Education, Orissa appointed Principals-cum-Secretary on deputation from
                time to time, with two stop gap arrangements during 25.09.1991 to 20.10.1992 and
                01.10.2006 to 17.03.2009. List of the Principals has been given separately.<br>
                Strength of the college continued to boom. At present the strength of the college
                reached the peak of 622 out of which girls being 240 and boys 382 in 2009-10.
            </p>
            <p>
                The college entered into the watershed phase when it introduced I.T. Education at
                the +2 stage and Science in degree stage. The leap forward got firmly placed as
                the college got registered under the U.G.C. Act 1956 vide clauses 2(f) and 12(b)
                with effect from 24.10 2008, a turning point for progress of the institution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The college got shifted to its own and new site in December 2000 with financial
                assistance extended by the M.L.A. and MPs from their respective LAD Funds and physical
                labour of the staff. All inputs put into prompt and potential performance expanded
                the academic panorama. With the increased number of staff members entering into
                Grant in-Aid fold, the internal resources of the college became viable to extend
                possible facilities for the quality education in the college. As per UGC guidelines
                and approval U.G.C programmes like Remedial Coaching Centre, Entry into Service
                Cell, Internal Quality Assurance Cell and Network Resource Centre will function
                from this session (2010-11) for the academic excellence and future of the students
                and others.<br>
                With the assistance of the U.G.C., technical assistance of Government of Odisha
                and other organisations the process is on to modernize its system of education and
                administration putting all activities “online”.
            </p>
            <p>
                As per UGC norms the college is striving strenuously for NAAC accreditation with
                all positive thoughts and actions. The Principal, staff, students and other related
                authorities and local elites are involved in the process.
